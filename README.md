# Extension Translation Tool
<br>This extension allows to import xlf file to Business Central, select a target language, make translation and export xlf with translated elements.
<br>The translation can be done manually or using DeepL API.
<br>The extension from which the imported xlf file originates does not need to be installed in Business Central, to which it is imported.
